The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a national health surveillance system
that records drug use contributing to hospital emergency department visits
throughout the United States. Simplices in this dataset are the drugs used by a
patient (as reported by the patient) in an emergency department visit. The
drugs include illicit substances, prescription and over-the-counter medication,
and dietary supplements. Timestamps of visits are recorded at the resolution
of quarter-years, spanning a total duration of 8 years. The timestamps are
encoded by the number (year * 4 + quarter), where year ranges from 2004 to 2011
and quarter ranges from 1 to 4.


The file DAWN-node-labels.txt maps the node IDs to the drugs.
