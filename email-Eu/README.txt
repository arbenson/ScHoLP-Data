The simplices in this dataset are constructed from the email-Eu dataset,
downloaded from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core-temporal.html.

The original data source only contains (sender, receiver, timestamp) tuples,
where timestamps are recorded at 1-second resolution. Simplices consist of a
sender and all receivers such that the email between the two has the same
timestamp.
