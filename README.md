# Simplicial Closure and Higher-order Link Prediction Data

This data accompanies the following paper:

- Simplicial closure and higher-order link prediction.
  Austin R. Benson, Rediet Abebe, Michael T. Schaub, Ali Jadbabaie, and Jon Kleinberg.
  2018.

There are two types of datasets. The first type is a timestamped sequence of
simplices, where a simplex is a set of k nodes from some vertex set. The second
type is a weighted projected graph, where the weight is the number of times that
two nodes co-appear in a simplex.
