# Simplicial Closure and Higher-order Link Prediction Data

This data accompanies the following paper:

- Simplicial closure and higher-order link prediction.
  Austin R. Benson, Rediet Abebe, Michael T. Schaub, Ali Jadbabaie, and Jon Kleinberg.
  2018.

Each datasets is timestamped sequence of simplices, where a simplex is a set of
k nodes from some vertex set. Some datasets contain metadata about the nodes
and simplices. Additional data, such as the weighted projected graphs used
in this paper (which are too large to store on GitHub), are available [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/index.html).
